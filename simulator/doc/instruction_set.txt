Instruction Set:
ADD R1 R2 R3     - opcode: 0 - Adds registers R2 and R3 and stores the result in R1
ADDI R1 R2 x     - opcode: 1 - Adds register R2 with immediate value x and stores the result in R1
SUB R1 R2 R3     - opcode: 2 - Subs the register R3 from R2 and stores the result in R1
B x              - opcode: 3 - Branch to instruction x
LD R1 R2 x       - opcode: 4 - Load from memory to register R1, using R2 as the base address and x as the offset
STR R1 R2 x      - opcode: 5 - Store value of R1 in memory, using R2 as the base address and x as the offset
